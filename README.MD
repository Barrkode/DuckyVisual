# DuckyVisual
DuckyVisual is an application that allows you to control the lighting color of each one of your keys. 
This application currently only supports the Shine 6 keyboard, but theorically every keyboard made by Ducky after the Shine 6 should be supported, however since I don't have these under my hand, they're not.
If you have one of these keyboards, reach me out at reachlink and I'll gladly make it supported !

What this application do is that it basically emulates the Ducky's software in order to switch the keyboard in "software" mode, and set it in a state where it's ready to receive key colors orders.

To change the color of the keys, a REST API server is launched on your computer, on the port 17742.

Just make POST calls to it with the help if the doc and you're done !
